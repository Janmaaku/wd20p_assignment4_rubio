                                    Tops Cebu is arguably the most famous lookout in Cebu City, with panoramic views of the 
                                    sprawling metropolitan, all the way out to Lapu Lapu and its neighbouring islands. Its a 
                                    popular spot amongst both locals and tourists to watch the sunset, take their significant 
                                    others on dates and have a cheap dinner under the stars. The best part is, it‚Äôs just a short
                                    drive from the city centre.

                                    Tops Cebu is in the mountainous town of Busay, around 25 mintues from Lahug City. If you have 
                                    your own car or motorbike you can just use the map below or Google Maps and search for Tops 
                                    Lookout. If you‚Äôre taking public transport, you can take any jeepney going to Busay and get 
                                    off at JY Square Mall. There will be plenty of motorcycle taxis (habal-habals) fighting for 
                                    your attention. Tell them you want to go to Tops Lookout and make sure you don‚Äôt pay more 
                                    than ‚Ç±100/USD $2. Lost looking tourists that don‚Äôt know any better can get ripped off, so now 
                                    you know the going rate is only ‚Ç±100.

                                    The , also called the bait ball, is a natural phenomenon that happens when massive schools 
                                    of sardines swim in the shallow waters to feed on planktons. They stick and swim together to 
                                    protect themselves from larger prey and generally stay safe in the ocean. The sardines are so 
                                    harmless that you can swim through them without getting grazed. And if you swim further up to 
                                    20-30 meters, you can see the colorful reefs filled with other vibrant creatures.

                                            What makes this tourist attraction even more awe-inspiring is that the magnificent creatures 
                                            are well protected, like the other natural spectacles on the island. Fishermen are prohibited 
                                            from catching or herding these fishes, so tourists can experience this event in its raw and

                                                Eighteen watchtowers were built here during the time of the 22nd Governor-General Sebastian Hurtado de Corcuera 
                                                when Moro pirates raided the island looking for slaves.
